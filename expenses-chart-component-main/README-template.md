## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learned all tailwind CSS code inside this project. It was completely new for me. 

### Continued development

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS in a project, and I really enjoyed the experience. I’m looking forward to using it more frequently, especially in combination with React JS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ ) - I used Tailwind CSS for this project, and I found the documentation to be incredibly helpful. It provided clear guidance and made it easy to find exactly what I needed throughout the development process.

- [Vibe coding](https://www.example.com) - Additionally, I leveraged AI tools to assist me during development. They were especially useful for debugging my code and offering suggestions, which significantly improved my workflow and efficiency.

- Git command : git rm -r --cache file_name/folder_name. This command allows to remove files only from the Git repository without deleting them from your local file system.
