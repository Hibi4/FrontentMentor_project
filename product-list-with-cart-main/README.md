## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the Bootstrap grid system, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Javascript. I learn React, how to use CSS inside it, how to use the react Bootsrtrap, how to use the react-icons and also event listener. I also integrate response design to allow the page to be responsive.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to continue to improve my React skills by creating more projects using React.
