## Overview

### The challenge

### Links

- Solution URL: (https://github.com/Hibi4/FrontentMentor_project.git)
- Live Site URL: (https://news-homepage-main-liart.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 

### What I learned

For this project, I used Bootstrap, Flexbox, CSS Grid and Javascript. It's not new for me but I practiced my knowledge during this project. I learn the CSS properties order to allow me to choose new things. 
I had some difficulty solving the challenge with the menu for mobile design. I couldn't exactly reproduce the design of the challenge.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.

### Useful resources

- Example resource 1 -  ```www.w3schools.com``` - This site helped me to search some CSS information.
- Example resource 2 - ```https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/``` - This site helped me    to use some bootstrap components.
