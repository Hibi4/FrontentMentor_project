## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 

### What I learned

For this project, I used Bootstrap, Flexbox, CSS Grid and Javascript. It's not new for me but I practice my knowledge during this project. I learn the CSS properties order to allow me to choose new things.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.

### Useful resources
