## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this project, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. It's not new for me but I practiced my knowledge during this project.

During this project, I discover a new CSS tag, the fill the linear-gradient. For this tag, I used the background linear gradient to fill the background of the chat app by filling up the div by differents background colors. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
background: linear-gradient(to right,
            hsl(276, 55%, 52%) 50%,
            whitesmoke 20% 40%,
            whitesmoke 40% 60%,
            whitesmoke 60% 80%,
            whitesmoke 80%);
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.
