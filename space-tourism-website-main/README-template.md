### What I learned

For this project, I used Bootstrap, Flexbox, CSS Grid and Javascript. It's not new for me, but I practiced my knowledge during this project. I learn the CSS properties order to allow me to choose new things.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.

### Useful resources

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.

I tried to use talwind css after finishing to implement the CSS code, but I couldn't use it well for some reasons I ignore. So I would like to use it in the future.
