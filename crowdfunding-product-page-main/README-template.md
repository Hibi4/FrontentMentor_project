### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js

function openModal() {
    modal.classList.remove('hidden');
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
}

function closeModal() {
    modal.classList.add('hidden');
    document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
}

```

### Continued development

This is one my few project using Tailwind CSS in a project, and I really enjoyed the experience. I’m looking forward to using it more frequently, especially in combination with React JS.
