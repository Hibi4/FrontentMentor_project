## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this project, I used Bootstrap, Flexbox, CSS Grid and Javascript. It's not new for me but I practice my knowledge during this project. I learn the CSS properties ```order``` to allow me to choose new things.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.

### Useful resources

- Example resource 1 - ``` www.w3schools.com``` - This site helped me to search some CSS information.
- Example resource 2 - ``` https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/ ``` This site    helped me to use some bootstrap components.
