### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

For this project, I used Flexbox and CSS Grid. It's not new for me but I practice my knowledge during this project.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.
