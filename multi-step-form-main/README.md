## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

For this project, I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. It's not new for me but I practiced my knowledge during this project.

During this project, I discover a new CSS tag, the fill the background-image to the screen. I used the tag background-size: cover; to do that.

```css
background-size: cover;
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to use some Front-end frameworks (react, angular etc...) to solve the challenges.
