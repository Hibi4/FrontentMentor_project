## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design
- vanilla Javascript 

### What I learned

For this project, I used Flexbox, CSS Grid and Javascript. It's not new to me, but I practice my knowledge on this project. I learn some new CSS properties in order to allow me to learn new things.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 I never use 'flex-grow' before. I learn many things by using it. 
  flex-grow: 1;
```
```js

- Using 'every' method was new to me . I did not realize this method exit before. It is a game changer.
- Using 'includes' is very helpful.
  return activeFilters.every(filter => jobTags.includes(filter));

```

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving this side projects by adding new features.
